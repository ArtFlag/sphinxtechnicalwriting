Tools
=====

The beauty of static website generators is that you can choose any tool to edit the source files. So you are free
to stick to your go-to editor.

Once again, the idea here to leverage what the developers have been battle-testing for a while such as:

- `VIM <https://www.vim.org/>`__: a free and amazing keyboard-only editor with a scary learning-curve but that allows you to type like no other editors.
- `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__: a free and highly customizable editor with a huge community behind it.
- `Atom <https://atom.io/>`__: the direct competitor of VS Code.
- `Sublime <https://www.sublimetext.com/>`__: a proprietary editor with extensions and great performance.

For me, the best editing tool for rST editing is `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__
with the following extensions:

- `VSCode Vim <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim>`__
- `reStructuredText <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lextudio.restructuredtext>`__
- `Python <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python>`__
- `Table formatter <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shuworks.vscode-table-formatter>`__
- `Git History <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.githistory>`__
- `Code Spell Checker <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker>`__
