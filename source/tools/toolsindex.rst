Tools
=====

The beauty of static website generators is that you or any contributor can choose any tool to edit the source
files.

Once again, the idea here to leverage what the developers have been battle-testing for a while such as these
editing tools:

- `VIM`_: a free and amazing keyboard-only editor with a nasty learning-curve but that
  allows you to edit files at the speed of light.
- `Visual Studio Code`_: a free and highly customizable editor with a huge
  community behind it.
- `Atom`_: the direct competitor of VS Code.
- `Sublime`_: a proprietary editor with extensions and great performance.


VS Code
-------

For me, `Visual Studio Code`_ is the best editor paired with the following
extensions:

- `VSCode Vim <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim>`_
- `reStructuredText <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lextudio.restructuredtext>`_
- `Python <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python>`_
- `Table formatter <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shuworks.vscode-table-formatter>`_
- `Git History <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.githistory>`_
- `Code Spell Checker <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker>`_
- `Vale <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=errata-ai.vale-server>`_
