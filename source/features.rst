Sphinx features for technical writing
=====================================

Sphinx offers some great features for technical writing. Some of them are offered out-of-the-box, some of them require
the installation of extensions.


Displaying the full table of contents
-------------------------------------

By default, Sphinx displayed the :abbr:`TOC (table of contents)` based on the page that the user is reading.

The scope changes depending on the page which can be a nightmare for certain users. I'm one of these users.
I feel that it is extremely confusing and prevents me from understanding the logic of the TOC designed by the writer.

Fear not, it is possible to display one static TOC by using the ``fulltoc`` extension.
Refer to the `installation procedure <https://sphinxcontrib-fulltoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#basic-installation>`__.

You can now split your TOC in as many sections as you need.

.. admonition:: Example

   The following code generates 2 separate sections with their own structure.

   .. code-block:: rst

      .. toctree::
      :caption: Integration guides

       myguide1.rst
       myguide2.rst

      .. toctree::
      :caption: API tutorials

       blablaapi.rst
       blibliapi.rst



Using aliases to create links
-----------------------------

Aliases are labels that you can attach to titles to avoid referring to the titles themselves
in case they change. Instead you create a link to the alias and you get the freedom of changing the corresponding title
as much as needed without worrying about broken links.

This is essential as Sphinx is not a CMS. Changing a file name of lists of titles can potentially be a lot of work compared to proprietary software
that will rename all links for you automatically.

For example, imagine the following title:

.. code-block:: rst

   Creating aliases
   ----------------


You can refer to it bu using the standard rST link markup:

.. code-block:: rst

   link to `Creating aliases`_

This link will be broken as soon as you change the title.

Instead, refer to a label:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. _create-alias:

   Creating aliases
   ----------------

And link to it:

.. code-block:: rst

   unbreakable link to :ref:`create-alias`

.. note:: You can only create such a link using the ``ref`` role, which is recommended in the vast majority of cases.


Boosting your productivity with the right editor
------------------------------------------------

For me, the best editing tool for rST editing is `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__.

It's a great piece of software out-of-the-box, but it really shines with the following extensions:

- `reStructuredText <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lextudio.restructuredtext>`__
- `Python <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python>`__
- `Table formatter <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shuworks.vscode-table-formatter>`__
- `Git History <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.githistory>`__
- `Code Spell Checker <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker>`__

You can probably look at `Atom <https://atom.io/>`_ as well for equivalent features.
