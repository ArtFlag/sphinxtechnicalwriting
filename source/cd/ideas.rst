Ideas
=====

Once you have set up your continuous deployment system, you can keep on improving things.

Here are a few ideas that you could try and look into:

- Docker: Docker allows you to create a container that contains everything required to build your documentation
  project. This would be the content of the ``requirements.txt`` file and the docs source files.

  The benefit of this approach is that non-technical users can easily be able to build the docs, therefore editing
  them.

  The drawback is that each build is slower.
