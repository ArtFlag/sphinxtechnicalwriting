# Sphinx Technical Writing

A [Sphinx-built website](https://artflag.github.io/sphinxtechnicalwriting/) about modern technical writing
using [Sphinx](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx).

This website/repository is aimed at technical writers. It provides some ideas and examples illustrating how to
set up self-publishing documentation and how to get the most out of Sphinx.

This is a work in progress. You might find typos and other delicacies but you should still take a look.
